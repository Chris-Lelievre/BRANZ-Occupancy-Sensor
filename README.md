# BRANZ-Occupancy-Sensor
This is the final code and report for the BRANZ Occupancy Sensor (B.O.S.)

The folder contains arduino code (which was implemented on a Feather M0 adatalogger), and the .exe is a compiled version of the .py python script.

You can find ALL the code over at this repository if you want it- https://github.com/Chris-Lelievre/BRANZ-Summer-Scholarship-16-17
