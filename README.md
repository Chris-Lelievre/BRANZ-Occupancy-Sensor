# BRANZ-Occupancy-Sensor
This is the final code and report for the BRANZ Occupancy Sensor (B.O.S.)
Sensing Occupant Prescence using a Low Cost Thermal Detector Array is the academic report that goes with this project. User Documentation contains brief instructions on how to build one of these sensors.


The folder contains arduino code (which was implemented on a Feather M0 adatalogger), and the .exe is a compiled version of the .py python script.

You can find ALL the code over at this repository if you want it- https://github.com/Chris-Lelievre/BRANZ-Summer-Scholarship-16-17
